# SalesTeamManager
We need an App, to manage our Sales teams, and, like all good internal Enterprise App, .NET, Microsoft is our best friend.



## From Source Requirements:

## Overview:
Create a web API that can parse a sales record file into an object. The API should return an object with the following fields:
* The median Unit Cost
* The most common Region
* The first and last Order Date and the days between them
* The total revenue
## Included:
* Sample input at `Input\SalesRecords.csv`
* A git ignore file for a C# project
* A git attributes file

<br></br>

We'll start with... the delicious and lovely - a web api blank: `dotnet new webapi`_
